What Is an IP Address?

An IP address (Internet Protocol address) is a unique numerical identifier assigned to every device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol.
Why IP Addresses Are Important

Device Identification

Every device (computer, mobile, server, router) needs an IP address to be uniquely identified on a network.

Communication Between Systems

IP addresses ensure data packets are sent from the correct source to the correct destination, enabling smooth communication over the internet.

Routing of Data

Routers use IP addresses to determine the best path for data to travel across networks.

Network Security & Investigation

Helps in tracking suspicious logins, tracing attackers, and detecting unauthorized access.

Used in log analysis, intrusion detection, and forensic investigations.

Location Identification (Approximate)

IP addresses can indicate geographical location (country, city, ISP), useful for access control and fraud detection.
Types of IP Addresses

IPv4 – 32-bit address (Example: 192.168.1.1)

IPv6 – 128-bit address (Example: 2001:db8::1)

Public vs Private IP

Public IP – Used to communicate over the internet

Private IP – Used within local networks (home, office)
IP Ranges

IP ranges are blocks of IP addresses assigned to networks. They define which IPs can be used for private networks (like 192.168.0.0–192.168.255.255) and public internet communication.

Domain Names

A domain name is a human-readable name (e.g., google.com) that represents the IP address of a server, making websites easier to access.

Domain Structure

Domain structure is the hierarchical organization of a domain name, such as Top-Level Domain (TLD) (.com), Second-Level Domain (google), and subdomains (www).

DNS Importance

DNS (Domain Name System) translates domain names into IP addresses, enabling users to access websites without remembering numerical IPs.

Ports

A port is a logical endpoint that identifies specific services or applications running on a device (e.g., Port 80 for HTTP, Port 443 for HTTPS).

Protocols

Protocols are standard rules that govern data communication between devices on a network, such as HTTP, FTP, TCP, and UDP
